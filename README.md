`leapgp` is an R package designed for fast sequential emulation of
computer models. Sequential emuulation is common in applications
requiring MCMC. The `leapgp` package is based on (CITATION ADDED SOON)
and can be viewed as a global model extension of the `laGP` method of
Apley and Gramacy 2015.

To install the package, use

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/leapgp")
```

The method is described in (CITATION ADDED SOON) and explicit code
examples are given in the vignette associated with this package.
