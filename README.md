`leapgp` is an R package designed for fast sequential emulation of
computer models. Sequential emulation is common in applications
requiring MCMC. The `leapgp` package is based on [Rumsey et
al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sta4.576)
and can be viewed as a global model extension of the `laGP` method of
Apley and Gramacy 2015.

To install the package, use

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/leapgp")
```

The method is described in [Rumsey et
al. (2023)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/sta4.576)
and explicit code examples are given in the vignette associated with
this package.
